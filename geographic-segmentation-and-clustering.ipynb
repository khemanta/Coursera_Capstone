    "**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**: In this assignment, we are going to explore, segment, and cluster the geographic data of the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so we need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data Source and Problem** : For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page [List of postal codes of Canada: M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. We will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset in lab exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy**: *Once the data is in a structured format, we can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.* \n",
    "\n",
    "The reference for New York city based neighborhoods segmentation and clustering is here. \n",
